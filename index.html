<p class="light">
    I'm a 17-year-old Mexican-American from Brooklyn, NY, currently attending high school and expected to graduate in June 2026. 
    I take city transportation daily, using the time to reflect or prepare for upcoming lessons. 
    I practice full-stack development, I'm on my secound year. After graduation, I plan to attend either a CUNY or SUNY college. 
    Some college majors I am considering include business, culinary arts, and computer science. While I'm still exploring my career path,

    (Small Office/Home Office) network, illustrating how the internet <br>

 you move forward on your journey. But if you make the wrong choice, it’s "GAME OVER," <br>
 and you’ll have to restart the entire game. The fate of your character is in your hands,<br>
  choose wisely, or risk losing everything.
