 I am currently 16 years old and proud to be Mexican-American, born and raised in Brooklyn, NY.
I take the city transportation every day to get to my schools, which gives me some time to reflect on my day or prepare for upcoming lessons.
I am expected to graduate from high school in June 2026, and after graduation, I plan to attend college or the army.
I am aiming to go to either a CUNY or SUNY college to continue my education and pursue my career goals. 
While I am still figuring out exactly what I want to pursue, 
I have a few career paths in mind that I am excited to explore.

    I am currently learning Full-Stack Development at the Brooklyn STEAM Center. 
    I'm from Brooklyn, NY, and I am a junior in high school. Every day, when I go to the STEAM Center, I gain new knowledge about Full-Stack development. 
    Right now, I am working on HTML and CSS. Before that, we learned how to build an adventure game, and we also covered Python, GitHub, and CSS. Since I attend two schools, 
    my schedule is a bit different this year. In the morning, I go to my home school, where I study math, art, and English. Then, during lunchtime, the school bus takes me to the STEAM Center, where I continue learning Full-Stack Development and Career Financial Management.

    I currently attend The High School for Global Citizenship, 
    which is located in Crown Heights, where I am working hard to expand my knowledge and develop important skills.
In addition to my home school, I also go to the Brooklyn STEAM Center, located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
 where I focus on learning about technology and developing skills in fields like full-stack development. Both schools offer unique opportunities for growth, 
 and I am excited about what the future holds as I continue to learn and explore different career options.
