    I am currently 17 years old and proud to be Mexican-American, born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Every day,
     I take public transportation to get to my schools, which gives me time to reflect, recharge, and prepare for the day ahead.
      I’m expected to graduate from high school in June 2026, and after graduation, I plan to either attend college.
    I’m currently considering several CUNY and SUNY colleges to continue my education and work toward my long-term career goals. While I haven’t 
    fully decided on a specific career path yet, I have a few options in mind that I am genuinely excited to explore. I look forward to growing both personally and professionally
     as I take the next steps after high school.

I am currently a senior in high school and in my second year of the Full-Stack Development program at the Brooklyn STEAM Center. I am from Brooklyn, NY,<br> and every day I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in web development. I am on track to graduate in June 2026.
    At the STEAM Center, we focus on both <br>
    front-end and back-end development. This year, we are working with Python, and last semester, I created a clicker game as part of our learning process. So far, I have gained <br> 
    experience with Python, GitHub, and CSS building a strong foundation in coding and collaborative development. Because I attend two schools, my schedule is unique. <br> In the mornings, I go to the Brooklyn STEAM Center to study Full-Stack Development. Then, around lunchtime, I take a school bus to my home high school, where I take additional classes including sociology, finance, swimming, and college readiness.
    Balancing two schools has helped me develop strong time management skills, and my experiences in both environments have shaped my academic and personal growth. I am excited to keep learning, building projects, and preparing for the next steps after high

    I currently attend The High School for Global Citizenship, 
    which is located in Crown Heights, where I am working hard to expand my knowledge and develop important skills.
In addition to my home school, I also go to the Brooklyn STEAM Center, located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
 where I focus on learning about technology and developing skills in fields like full-stack development. Both schools offer unique opportunities for growth, 
 and I am excited about what the future holds as I continue to learn and explore different career options.
