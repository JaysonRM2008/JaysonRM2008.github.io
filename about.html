<p>
I am learing <b> Full-stack Development </b> at the Brooklyn Steam Center. I am from Brooklyn NY, 
and I am an Junior in high school. 
Every day when I go to the Beooklyn STEAM Center I learn new things about Full Stack. For example, I am 
currenly working on HTML. But before I was working on HTML, we were learning how to build a Game Adventure, how to use python, github, and CSS. Since I go to 2 schools my scheduled is different this year. In the moring I go to my hone school 
where I learn math, art, and english. Then when is lunch time in my school, the school bus takes me to Steam and thats where I learn Full Stack Development and Career Financial Management.
